## What is Client and Server?

Your browser relies on the internet, which is a network of computers
that send messages to each other. We call these messages packets. Packets
include the data you’re sending and information about where that data
is coming from and where it’s going. Every computer on the internet
has an address for sending packets to it. 

But some computers only
accept certain types of packets, and others only allow packets from a
restricted list of other computers. It’s then up to the receiving computer
to determine what to do with the packets and how to respond. For the
purposes of this book, we’ll focus only on the data included in the
packets (the HTTP messages), not the packets themselves.
I’ll refer to these computers as either clients or servers. 

The
computer initiating requests is typically referred to as the client
regardless of whether the request is initiated by a browser, command
line, or so on. Servers refer to the websites and web applications
receiving the requests. If the concept is applicable to either clients or
servers, I refer to computers in general.

Because the internet can include any number of computers talking
to each other, we need guidelines for how computers should
communicate over the internet. This takes the form of Request for
Comment (RFC) documents, which define standards for how computers
should behave. For example, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
defines how your internet browser communicates with a remote server
using Internet Protocol (IP). 

In this scenario, both the client and server
must agree to implement the same standards so they can understand the
packets each is sending and receiving.
