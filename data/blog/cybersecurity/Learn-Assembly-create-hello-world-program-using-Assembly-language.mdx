## What is Assembly Language?

Assembly language is a low-level language that can write instruction 
the processors can understand. By using Assembly, developers can write human-readable
machine instruction, which are then assembled into machine code, so that 
the processor can directly run them. For example, the Assembly code `add rax, 1` is much more
intuitive and easier to remember than the equivalent machine shellcode `4883C001`
and easier than the equivalent machine code `01001000 10000011 11000000 00000001`

## What is shellcode
Machine code is often represented as Shellcode, a hex representation of machine code bytes.
Shellcode can be translated back to its Assembly and can also be loaded directly into memory
as binary instructions to be executed.

## History of Assembly Language
As there are different processor designs, each processor understands a different set of 
machine instruction and a different Assembly language. In the pas, application had to be written
i Assembly for each processor, so it was not easy to develop an application for multiple
processor.

In early 1970, high level language like **C** were develop to make it possible to write a single
easy to understand code that work on any processor without rewriting it for each processor.
This was made possible by creating compiler for each language.

Later on, interpreted languages were develop, like **Python, PHP, Bash, Javascript**, and others,
which are usually not compiled but are interpreted during run time. These type of languages utilize pre-build libraries 
to run their instructions.These libraries are typically written and compiled in other high-level languages like **C** or **C++**

## Computer Architecture
Today, most modern computers are built on what is known as the Von Neumann Architecture, which was developed back in 1945 by Von Neuman
This Architecture executes machine code to perform specific algorithms. It mainly consist of
the following elements.
- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Memory Unit
- Input/Output devices

The CPU itself consist of three main components
- Control Unit (CU)
- Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)
- Registers

Assembly languages mainly work with the CPU and memory. This is why it is crucial 
to understand the general design of computer architecture, so when we start using 
assembly instructions to move and process data, we know where it's going and coming 
from and how fast/expensive each instruction is. But for now, we will not discuss 
about computer architecture in detail because it will need his own article, we will
just want to focus on assembly languages.

## What is Registers
Each CPU core has a set of register, The registers are the fastest components in any computer
as they are build within the CPU core. However, register are very limited in sized and 
can only store a few bytes of data at a time.

There are 2 most common types of registers, **Data Registers** and **Pointer Registers**.

- **Data Registers**, are usually used for storing **instruction/syscall arguments**, The primary data register are **rax,rbx,rcx, and rdx**, The
**rdi** and **rsi** registers also exist and are usually used for the instruction **destination** and **source** operands. Then
, the secondary data registers that can be used when all previous registers are in use, which are **r8,r9,** and **r10**.

- **Pointer Registers**, are used to store specific important address pointers. The main pointer registers 
are the Base Stack Pointer **rbp**, which points to the **beginning of the Stack**, the 
Current Stack Pointer **rsp**, which points to the **current location within the Stack** 
(top of the Stack), and the Instruction Pointer **rip**, which holds the **address of 
the next instruction**.

## What is Sub-Registers
Each **64-bit** register can be further divided into smaller sub-registers 
containing the lower bits, at one byte **8-bits**, 2 bytes **16-bits**, and 4 
bytes **32-bits**. Each sub-register can be used and accessed on its own, 
so we don't have to consume the full 64-bits if we have a smaller amount of data.

|sized in bits |sized in bytes |name                   |example |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------|
|16-bit        |2 bytes        |the base name          |**ax**     |
|8-bit         |1 bytes        |base name and/or end with l          |**al**      |
|32-bit        |4 bytes        |base name + starts with e          |**eax**      |
|64-bit        |8 bytes        |base name + start with r          |**rax**      |

The following are the names of the sub-register for all of the essential register in an
x86_64 architecture. The description will show the data/or arguments Register accept.

#### Data/Arguments Registers
|Description   |64-bit register|32-bit register|16-bit register| 8-bit register |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
|syscall number/ return value| rax | eax | ax | al |
|Callee saved, used to hold long-lived values that shoud be preserved across calls| rbx | ebx | bx | bl|
|1st arg - Destination operand| rdi | edi | ax | al |
|2nd arg - Source operand| rsi | esi | si | sil |
|3rd arg| rdx | edx | dx | dl |
|4th arg - Loop counter| rcx | ecx | cx | cl |
|5th arg| r8 | r8d | r8w | r8b |
|6th arg| r9 | r9d | r9w | r9b |

#### Pointers Registers
|Description   |64-bit register|32-bit register|16-bit register| 8-bit register |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
|Base Stack Pointer| rbp | ebp | bp | bpl |
|Current/Top Stack Pointer| rsp | esp | sp | spl |
|Instruction Pointer 'call only'| rip | eip | ip | ipl |

## Memory Addresses
64-bit processors have 64-bit wide addresses that 
range from **0x0** to **0xffffffffffffffff**, so we expect the addresses to be in this 
range. However, **RAM is segmented into various regions, like the Stack, the heap, 
and other program and kernel-specific regions**. Each memory region has specific **read,
write, execute** permissions that specify whether we can read from it, write to it, or call an address in it.

Whenever an instruction goes through the Instruction Cycle to be executed, 
the first step is to fetch the instruction from the address it's located at.
There are several types of address fetching in the x86 architecture.
|Addressing Mode/ types of address fetching   |Description|example|
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
|Immediate   |The value is given within the instruction|add 2
|Register   |The register name that holds the value is given in the instruction|add rax|
|Direct   |The direct full address is given in the instruction|call 0xffffffffaa8a25ff|
|Indirect   |A reference pointer is given in the instruction|call 0x44d000 or call [rax]|
|Stack   |Address is on top of the stack|add rsp|

In the above table, lower is slower.The less immediate the value is, the slower it is to fetch it.

## Address Endianness
Address Endianness is the order of its bytes in which they are stored or retrieved from memory.
There are two types of Endianness, **Little-Endian** and **Big-Endian**. Basically, with Little-Endian addresses
is filled/retrieved first **right-to-left**. while with Big-Endian processor, addresses is
filled/retrieved first **left-to-right**.

for example if we have address 0x0011223344556677, this table will demonstrates
how the address value stored.
|Address type |How the value stored| Address value|
|-------------|--------------------|--------------|
|little endian|77 66 55 44 33 22 11 00|0x7766554433221100|
|big endian   |00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77|0x0011223344556677|

When retrieving he value, the processor has to use the same Endianness 
used when storing them, or it will get the wrong value.

## Data types
in the x64 architecture, they support many types of data sizes. 
for example byte, word, double word(dword), and quad word(qword).

>a character used 4 bit in sizes, for example a or b

|Name         |Lenght              | Example    |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------|
|byte| 8 bits or 1 bytes| 0xab|
|word| 16 bits or 2bytes|0xabcd|
|dword|32 bits or 4 bytes|0xabcdef12
|qword|64 bits or 8 bytes|0xabcdef1234567890|

> operands are the registers or subregisters use when doing instruction

When using a varible with certain data type or use a data type with an instruction,
both operand should be in the same size for example doing calculation using 32 bit subregister
`add ebx, eax` they both are dword data types. the appropriate data type for each subregisters is
- **al** for **byte**
- **ax** for **word**
- **eax** for **dword**
- **rax** for **qword**

## Assembly file structure
Assembly language have three main part.
|section|description|
|-------|-----------|
|**global_start**|This is a directive that directs the code to start executing|
|**section.data**|This is data section, which should contain all of the variables|
|**section.text**|This is te text section containing all of the code to be executed|

> Both the .data and .text sections refer to the data and text memory segments,
in which these instructions will be stored

## Create Hello world program using Assembly
First create file name helloworld.s, then we type the following code, on my example i use nano,
a build-in text editor for linux.

```s:code
        global _start ; direct where code to start executing

        section .data ; this section contains all of the variables
message: db     "Hello World!!"

        section .text
_start:                ; this is place where code start executing
        mov     rax, 1
        mov     rdi, 1
        mov     rsi, message
        move    rdx, 13
        syscall

        mov     rax, 60
        mov     rdi, 0
        syscall

```
## Assembling and linking assembly code.
Before this code can executed, we must first Assembling the code and then 
linking to get OS librabries that may be needed.

 #### Assembling code
```
nasm -f elf64 helloWorld.s
```
the -f elf64 flag is used to note that we want to assemble a 64-bit assembly code. if we want
to assemble a 32-bit code, we would use -f elf. The output from this command is .o file.

#### Linking file
The final step is linking the file using ld command. if we want to assemble a 32-bit binary,
we must add -m elf_i386 flag.
```
ld -o helloWorld helloWorld.o
```

Great now, we have our first program created using assembly language.
