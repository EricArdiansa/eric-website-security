## What's vulnerabilities?

A vulnerability is a weakness in an application that allows a malicious
person to perform some unpermitted action or gain access to
information they shouldn’t otherwise be allowed to access.
As you learn and test applications, keep in mind that vulnerabilities
can result from attackers performing intended and unintended actions.
For example, changing the ID of a record identifier to access
information you shouldn’t have access to is an example of an
unintended action.

Suppose a website allowed you to create a profile with your name,
email, birthday, and address. It would keep your information private
and share it only with your friends. But if the website allowed anyone to
add you as a friend without your permission, this would be a
vulnerability. Even though the site kept your information private from
non-friends, by allowing anyone to add you as a friend, anyone could
access your information. As you test a site, always consider how
someone could abuse existing functionality.
